# Battleships

Battleship is a guessing game for two players. In this case it is player against computer.

It is played on four grids. Two grids (one for each player) are used to mark each players' fleets of ships.

The locations of the fleet (these first two grids) are concealed from the other player so that they do not know the positions of the opponent's ships.

Players alternate turns by "firing" at the other player's ships. The objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's entire fleet. 

In your game, "firing" will be allowing the player to take a guess at where on the grid their opponent may have placed a ship.

The game is played on four grids, two for each player. Each player has a Battlefield Grid and a Firing Grid. The grids are a 10 by 10 square. 

The individual squares in the grid are identified by the x coordinate (indicated by a letter) followed by the y coordinate (indicated by a number). 

The game is played in rounds. In each round, each player takes a turn to fire at a target square in the opponent's Battlefield Grid.

The opponent then indicates whether the shot was a hit (a ship occupied the square) or a miss (there was no ship in the square).

If the shot is a "miss", the attacked player marks their Battlefield Grid with a white peg (X in our game); 

if a "hit" they mark their Battlefield Grid with a red peg (O in our game).

The attacking player then indicates the hit or miss on their Tracking Grid with the appropriate color peg (red (0) for "hit", white (X) for "miss") so that they can understand where the opponent's Ship might be.In the board game, once all the coordinates of a ship have been hit, the Ship is sunk, and the Ship's owner announces, "You sunk my battleship! (Or whatever the particular Ship is  that was destroyed).

For our purposes, we will consider a battleship sunk if the opponent has a single hit. When all of one player's ships are sunk, the other player wins the game.
